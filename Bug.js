This error occurs when you try to access a component's state or props before it has mounted.  This often happens within lifecycle methods like `constructor` or `componentWillMount` (although `componentWillMount` is deprecated) because the component hasn't received its initial props or had its state fully initialized yet.  Attempting to use `this.state` or `this.props` in these methods will result in `undefined` or an error.
